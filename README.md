ASSINGMENT 1 : Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-
machine in Java using object oriented feature. Implementation should consist of a few
instructions from each category and few assembler directives.

ASSINGMENT 2 : Implement Pass-II of two pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java using object oriented
features. The output of assignment-1 (intermediate file and symbol table) should be
input for this assignment.

ASSINGMENT 4 : Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of compiler to
generate tokens of subset of ‘Java’ program.

ASSINGMENT 5 : Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of compiler to
count no. of words, lines and characters of given input file.
